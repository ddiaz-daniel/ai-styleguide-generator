M&auml;ngel / Gew&auml;hrleistung</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unter der Voraussetzung, dass der Kunde den Style Guide Generator gem&auml;&szlig; den jeweils geltenden Einsatzbedingungen eingesetzt und genutzt hat, leisten wir nach Ma&szlig;gabe der Bestimmungen dieser Bedingungen Gew&auml;hr daf&uuml;r, dass der Style Guide Generator die vereinbarte Funktionalit&auml;t aufweist. Die Gew&auml;hrleistungsfrist betr&auml;gt 6 Monate ab Freischaltung des Zugangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ein Mangel liegt nur vor, soweit es sich um funktionsst&ouml;rende Abweichungen von endg&uuml;ltigen Spezifikationen handelt. F&uuml;r geringf&uuml;gige und/oder unerhebliche M&auml;ngel oder Fehler wird keine Gew&auml;hr geleistet; insbesondere gilt dies f&uuml;r jene M&auml;ngel, durch die die vereinbarte oder gew&ouml;hnlich vorausgesetzte Benutzbarkeit nicht beeintr&auml;chtigt wird. Wir leisten auch keine Gew&auml;hr daf&uuml;r, dass Programme in der vom Kunden getroffenen Auswahl zusammenarbeiten, dass diese ununterbrochen fehlerfrei laufen oder zur Erzielung bestimmter unternehmerischer Resultate eingesetzt bzw. bestimmte Resultate erzielt werden k&ouml;nnen. Ein Mangel ist auch dann nicht von uns zu vertreten, wenn der Mangel auf die vom Kunden vorgegebene Aufgabenstellung oder dessen unzureichende oder fehlerhafte Mitwirkungspflicht zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren ist oder die Funktionen den Anforderungen des Kunden nicht gen&uuml;gen. Die Gew&auml;hrleistung entf&auml;llt ferner, wenn der Kunde oder ein Dritter eigenm&auml;chtig &Auml;nderungen vornimmt bzw. vorgenommen hat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Allf&auml;llige M&auml;ngel hat der Kunde schriftlich mit genauer Beschreibung des Problems zu r&uuml;gen. Die Gew&auml;hrleistung umfasst die M&auml;ngeldiagnose und die M&auml;ngelbeseitigung. Wir unterst&uuml;tzen den Kunden bei der Suche nach Mangel und Mangelursache. Wenn der Kunde nicht nachweisen kann, dass der Mangel uns zuzuordnen ist, sind wir berechtigt, die von uns bez&uuml;glich der M&auml;ngeldiagnose und M&auml;ngelbeseitigung erbrachten Leistungen dem Kunden in Rechnung zu stellen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Die Beseitigung von M&auml;ngeln erfolgt prim&auml;r durch Verbesserung. Die Verbesserung erfolgt nach unserer Wahl durch M&auml;ngelbeseitigung, durch eine entsprechende &Auml;nderung des Style Guide Generators, durch &Uuml;berlassung eines neuen Programmstandes oder dadurch, dass wir eine zumutbare M&ouml;glichkeit aufzeigt, die Auswirkungen des Mangels zu vermeiden. Der Kunde kann Wandlung des Vertrages oder Minderung des Entgelts nur insoweit und nur dann verlangen, wenn die (gegebenenfalls mehrfache) Verbesserung des Mangels trotz einer schriftlich gesetzten angemessenen, mindestens 30-t&auml;gigen Nachfrist endg&uuml;ltig fehlschl&auml;gt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">10.
